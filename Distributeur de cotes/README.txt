This is our project in C# to understand the concept of object programming.
Our little programm can acces to data about some students, courses, etc.

When you'll launch our programm, it will display somee option like this:
1)See Bulletin
2)see who attends an activity
3)See the activity average
4)List different entities
5)Exit
6)Dunno LOL

##First Activity
if you chose the 1 you'll be proposed to choose a student.
Attention please! You need to write his name correctly and entirely to let the programm work ;) 

If the student is not recognized, the programm will say that there is "No such person"

If the student is recognized, it will display his complete name with all his courses, the number of ects of the courses, the evaluation for each activity and the final average. 

If the student has not yet any evaluation, the program will say it.

After that you can consult another student or write "exit" to return at the main menu.


##Second Activity
if you chose the 2 you'll be proposed to choose a class.
Write the name of class chosen and it will display the students who are attending this class.
